		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>Until the independence of India, the "Indian Army" was a
			British-commanded force defined as "the force recruited locally and
			permanently based in India, together with its expatriate British
			officers, the "British Army in India" referred to British Army units
			posted to India for a tour of duty. The "Army of India" meant the
			combined Indian Army and the British Army in India.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>British India Army</h3>
	
		<p>The British Indian Army was a critical force for maintaining
			the primacy of the British Empire, both in India and throughout the
			world. Besides maintaining the internal security of the British Raj,
			the Army fought in many other theatres: the Anglo-Burmese Wars; the
			First and Second Anglo-Sikh wars the First, Second, and Third
			Anglo-Afghan wars the First and Second opium wars, and the Boxer
			Rebellion in China and in Abyssinia.</p>
		<h3>World Wars</h3>
		<p>In the 20th century, the British Indian Army was a crucial
			adjunct to British forces in both world wars. 1.3 million Indian
			soldiers served in World War I (1914-1918) with the Allies, in which
			74,187 Indian troops were killed or missing in action.In 1915 there
			was a mutiny by Indian soldiers in Singapore. The United Kingdom made
			promises of self-governance to the Indian National Congress in return
			for its support but reneged on them after the war, following which
			the Indian Independence movement gained strength.</p>
		<p>In World War II Indian soldiers fought alongside the Allies. In
			1939, British officials had no plan for expansion and training of
			Indian forces, which comprised about 130,000 men (in addition there
			were 44,000 men in British units in India in 1939), whose mission was
			internal security and defence against a possible Soviet threat
			through Afghanistan. As the war progressed, the size and role of the
			Indian Army expanded dramatically, and troops were sent to
			battlefronts as soon as possible. The most serious problem was the
			lack of equipment.[25] Indian units served in Burma, wherein 1944-45,
			five Indian divisions were engaged along with one British and three
			African divisions. Even larger numbers operated in the Middle East.
			Some 87,000 Indian soldiers died in the war. By the end of the war,
			it had become the largest volunteer army in history, rising to over
			2.5 million men in August 1945.</p>
		<h2>Indian Independence</h2>
		<p>Upon the Partition of India and Indian independence in 1947,
			four of the ten Gurkha regiments were transferred to the British
			Army. The rest of the British Indian Army was divided between the
			newly created nations of India and Pakistan. The Punjab Boundary
			Force, which had been formed to help police Punjab during the
			partition period, was disbanded.[30] Headquarters Delhi and the East
			Punjab Command were formed to administer the area.</p>
		<p>The departure of virtually all senior British officers
			following independence, and their replacement by Indian officers,
			meant many of the latter held acting ranks several ranks above their
			substantive ones. For instance, S. M. Shrinagesh, the ground-forces
			commander of Indian forces during the first Indo-Pak War of 1947-49
			(and the future third COAS), was first an acting major-general and
			then an acting lieutenant-general during the conflict while holding
			the substantive rank of major, and only received a substantive
			promotion to lieutenant-colonel in August 1949.[31] Gopal Gurunath
			Bewoor, the future ninth COAS, was an acting colonel at his promotion
			to substantive major from substantive captain in 1949, while future
			Lieutenant General K. P. Candeth was an acting brigadier (substantive
			captain) at the same time.In April 1948, the former Viceroy's
			Commissioned Officers (VCO) were re-designated Junior Commissioned
			Officers, while the former King's Commissioned Indian Officers (KCIO)
			and Indian Commissioned Officers (ICO), along with the former Indian
			Other Ranks (IOR), were respectively re-designated as Officers and
			Other Ranks.</p>
		<p>Army Day is celebrated on 15 January every year in India, in
			recognition of Lieutenant General K. M. Cariappa's taking over as the
			first commander-in-chief of the Indian Army from General Sir Francis
			Butcher, the last British commander-in-chief of India, on 15 January
			1949. With effect from 26 January 1950, the date India became a
			republic, all active-duty Indian Army officers formerly holding the
			King's Commission were recommissioned and confirmed in their
			substantive ranks.</p>
