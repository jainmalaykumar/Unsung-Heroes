		<h2>Mission and Doctrine</h2>
		<p>Initially, the army's main objective was to defend the nation's
			frontiers. However, over the years, the army has also taken up the
			responsibility of providing internal security, especially against
			insurgencies in Kashmir and Northeast India. Currently, the army is
			also looking at enhancing its special forces capabilities. With
			India's increasing international role, and the requirement to protect
			its interests in far-off countries becoming important, the Indian
			Army and the Indian Navy are jointly planning to set up a marine
			brigade.</p>
		<p>The current combat doctrine of the Indian Army is based on
			effectively utilising holding formations and strike formations. In
			the case of an attack, the holding formations would contain the enemy
			and strike formations would counter-attack to neutralise enemy
			forces. In the case of an Indian attack, the holding formations would
			pin enemy forces down, whilst the strike formations would attack at a
			point of India's choosing. The Indian Army is large enough to devote
			several corps to the strike role.</p>

		<h2>Operations</h2>
		<p>From he time of independence until now, Indian Army has
			performed various operations, on our land as well as on foreign land.
			Here is a list of few such operations.</p>
		<h4>First Kashmir War (1947)</h4>
		<p>Immediately after independence, tensions between India and
			Pakistan erupted into the first of three full-scale wars between the
			two nations over the then princely state of Kashmir. The Maharaja of
			Kashmir wanted to have a standstill position. Since Kashmir was a
			Muslim majority state, Pakistan wanted to make Kashmir a Pakistani
			territory. As a result, Pakistan invaded Kashmir on 22 October 1947,
			causing Maharaja Hari Singh to look to India, specifically to Lord
			Mountbatten of Burma, the governor-general, for help. He signed the
			Instrument of Accession to India on 26 October 1947. Indian troops
			were airlifted to Srinagar from dawn on 27 October. This contingent
			included General Thimayya who distinguished himself in the operation
			and in the years that followed became a Chief of the Indian Army. An
			intense war was waged across the state and former comrades found
			themselves fighting each other. Pakistan suffered significant losses.
			Its forces were stopped on the line formed which is now called the
			Line of Control (LOC).</p>
		
		<h4>Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971</h4>
		<p>An independence movement broke out in East Pakistan which was
			crushed by Pakistani forces. Due to large-scale atrocities against
			them, thousands of Bengalis took refuge in neighbouring India causing
			a major refugee crisis there. In early 1971, India declared its full
			support for the Bengali freedom fighters, known as Mukti Bahini, and
			Indian agents were extensively involved in covert operations to aid
			them.</p>
		<h4>Kargil war (1999)</h4>
		<p>In 1998, India carried out nuclear tests; and a few days later,
			Pakistan responded with nuclear tests of its own, giving both
			countries nuclear deterrence capability, although India had tested a
			hydrogen bomb, which Pakistan lacked. Diplomatic tensions eased after
			the Lahore Summit was held in 1999. However, the sense of optimism
			was short-lived. In mid-1999, Pakistani paramilitary forces and
			Kashmiri insurgents captured the deserted, but strategic, Himalayan
			heights in the Kargil district of India. These had been vacated by
			the Indian Army during the onset of the inhospitable winter and were
			to be reoccupied in spring. The troops that took control of these
			areas received important support, of both arms and supplies, from
			Pakistan.</p>
		<h4>2016 Surgical Strikes on Kashmir and the 2016-2018
			India-Pakistan conflict</h4>
		<p>On 18 September 2016, a fedayeen attack was made by four armed
			militants on an army base near the town of Uri. Nineteen Indian Army
			soldiers were killed. India accused Jaish-e-Muhammad, a
			Pakistan-based terrorist organisation. On 29 September 2016, the
			India Army announced that it conducted "surgical strikes" against
			militant launch pads across the Line of Control, in
			Pakistani-administered Kashmir, and inflicted "significant
			casualties". Indian media reported the casualty figures variously
			from 35 to 70 killed. Partial footage of the strikes was released to
			the Indian media on 27 June 2018 as proof of the strike.The incident
			triggered the 2016-2018 India-Pakistan border conflict, which ended
			on 16 June 2018 with both India and Pakistan agreeing on a ceasefire.</p>
